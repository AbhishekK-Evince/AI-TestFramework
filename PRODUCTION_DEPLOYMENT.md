# Production Deployment Guide

## ✅ Session Management in Production

The session management and data cleanup system will work **exactly the same** in production as it does in development. Here's what's included:

### 🔐 **Session Management Features**
- ✅ **User Isolation**: Each user gets unique data space
- ✅ **Automatic Cleanup**: Data deleted based on retention periods
- ✅ **Configurable Settings**: Easy to modify via `session-config.json`
- ✅ **Production Ready**: All features work in built executable

### 🧹 **Automatic Cleanup in Production**
- ✅ **Scheduled Cleanup**: Runs every 24 hours automatically
- ✅ **User-Specific**: Only cleans current user's data
- ✅ **Retention Periods**: Configurable per data type
- ✅ **Logging**: All cleanup activities are logged

## 🚀 **Deployment Steps**

### 1. Build the Application
```bash
npm run build
```

### 2. Distribute the Executable
- **File**: `dist-new/AI Test Framework Setup 1.0.0.exe`
- **Size**: ~123 MB
- **Type**: Windows Installer

### 3. Installation
- Run the installer on target machines
- Application will be installed with all session management features
- Each user gets their own isolated data space

## 🔧 **Production Configuration**

### Session Cleanup Settings
The application uses `session-config.json` for configuration:

```json
{
  "sessionCleanup": {
    "enabled": true,
    "retentionPeriods": {
      "testcase_generator": 30,
      "codegen_recordings": 60,
      "generated_scripts": 45,
      "winston_logs": 90
    },
    "cleanupInterval": 24
  }
}
```

### MongoDB Requirements
- **Connection**: Must be accessible from production machines
- **Collections**: Will be created automatically
- **Indexes**: User ID indexes for performance

## 📊 **Production Monitoring**

### Cleanup Logs
Monitor cleanup activities in application logs:
```
Session cleanup scheduled every 24 hours
Running scheduled session cleanup...
Cleaned up 15 old documents from testcase_generator (older than 30 days)
Session cleanup completed: 23 total documents removed
```

### Database Monitoring
- Monitor collection sizes
- Check cleanup effectiveness
- Verify user isolation

## 🔒 **Security in Production**

### Data Isolation
- ✅ **User-Specific Data**: Each user only sees their own data
- ✅ **Session Tracking**: Complete audit trail
- ✅ **Automatic Cleanup**: Reduces data exposure risk

### Access Control
- ✅ **Machine-Based User ID**: Unique per machine
- ✅ **Session-Based Tracking**: Per-app-session isolation
- ✅ **MongoDB Filtering**: Server-side data filtering

## 🛠️ **Production Maintenance**

### Updating Cleanup Settings
1. Modify `session-config.json`
2. Rebuild application
3. Distribute new version

### Monitoring Cleanup
- Check application logs for cleanup activities
- Monitor database size and growth
- Verify retention periods are appropriate

### Manual Cleanup (if needed)
```bash
# Run cleanup script if needed
node cleanup-old-data.js
```

## 📈 **Performance in Production**

### Benefits
- ✅ **Reduced Database Size**: Automatic cleanup prevents growth
- ✅ **Faster Queries**: Less data to scan
- ✅ **Better Resource Usage**: Efficient storage management
- ✅ **Scalable**: Works for any number of users

### Optimization
- **Retention Periods**: Adjust based on usage patterns
- **Cleanup Frequency**: Modify based on data volume
- **Database Indexes**: Ensure proper indexing on userId

## 🔍 **Troubleshooting Production Issues**

### Cleanup Not Working
- Check MongoDB connection
- Verify cleanup is enabled
- Review application logs

### Data Isolation Issues
- Verify userId generation
- Check MongoDB queries
- Review session initialization

### Performance Issues
- Monitor database size
- Check cleanup frequency
- Review retention periods

## ✅ **Production Checklist**

- [ ] Application builds successfully
- [ ] Session management works in development
- [ ] MongoDB connection configured
- [ ] Cleanup settings configured
- [ ] Application tested with multiple users
- [ ] Logs monitored for cleanup activities
- [ ] Database size monitored
- [ ] User isolation verified

## 🎯 **Expected Behavior in Production**

1. **First Launch**: Session initialized, cleanup scheduled
2. **Data Creation**: All data tagged with userId and sessionId
3. **Data Retrieval**: Only user's own data returned
4. **Automatic Cleanup**: Old data removed based on retention periods
5. **Logging**: All activities logged for monitoring

The session management system is **production-ready** and will work identically across all deployed instances!
